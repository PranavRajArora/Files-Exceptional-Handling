    "Q.1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled language?\n",
    "A.1. The difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how the code is executed by a computer. In compiled languages, the source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before the program runs, resulting in faster execution and better performance. Examples include C and C++. Interpreted languages are executed line-by-line at runtime by an interpreter, which makes them more flexible and easier to debug but generally slower. Python and JavaScript are common examples. Some languages, like Java and Python, use a hybrid approach, compiling to intermediate bytecode that is then interpreted by a virtual machine."

    "A.6. In Python, the distinction between import and from ... import revolves around how external code is incorporated into your program. Utilizing import loads the whole module, requiring you to reference its functions or variables with the module name as a prefix (e.g., math.sqrt(16)). Conversely, from ... import enables you to import specific components of a module directly, allowing you to use them without the module prefix (e.g., sqrt(16)). While from ... import can result in shorter, more convenient code, it can also lead to name conflicts if multiple modules contain items with identical names. Alternatively, import helps to maintain a cleaner namespace and is generally considered safer in larger applications."

    "A.9. The difference between multithreading and multiprocessing lies in how they handle tasks to achieve concurrency or parallelism. Multithreading runs multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory space, which makes communication between threads easy but can be limited by Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), meaning only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. It’s best suited for I/O-bound tasks like reading files or network operations. In contrast, multiprocessing runs multiple processes independently, each with its own memory space and Python interpreter, allowing true parallelism on multiple CPU cores. This makes multiprocessing better for CPU-bound tasks like heavy computations, but inter-process communication is more complex and slower compared to threads."

This system helps prevent memory leaks by freeing memory when objects are no longer needed, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about manual memory allocation or deallocation."

Memory management is important in Python because it ensures that a program uses memory efficiently, preventing issues like memory leaks or excessive memory consumption that can slow down or crash applications. Proper memory management helps free up resources when they are no longer needed, allowing Python programs to run smoothly, especially for long-running processes or those handling large amounts of data. By automatically handling allocation and deallocation through techniques like reference counting and garbage collection, Python helps developers avoid manual memory errors and focus on writing clean, reliable code."

    "Q.14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "A.14. The try and except blocks in Python work together to handle errors that might occur during program execution. The try block contains code that could potentially raise an exception, while the except block defines how to respond if a specific error happens. When an exception occurs inside the try block, Python immediately stops executing that block and looks for a matching except block to handle the error, allowing the program to continue running instead of crashing. This mechanism helps make programs more robust and user-friendly by gracefully managing unexpected problems."

    "A.15. Python’s garbage collection system works primarily through reference counting combined with a cyclic garbage collector. Every object in Python keeps track of how many references point to it (reference count). When this count drops to zero—meaning no part of the program is using the object anymore—Python immediately frees the memory. However, reference counting alone can’t handle reference cycles (objects referencing each other). To solve this, Python has a cyclic garbage collector that periodically looks for groups of objects involved in such cycles and cleans them up if they’re no longer accessible. This two-part system helps manage memory efficiently and automatically without requiring the programmer to manually free memory.\n"

It provides a clean way to separate the main logic that depends on successful execution from the error-handling code. If an exception occurs, the else block is skipped, but if everything runs smoothly, the else block executes after the try. This helps keep the code more organized and readable."

When a file is open, the operating system keeps it locked or reserved, and failing to close it can lead to resource leaks, which might cause your program or other programs to run out of available file handles. Additionally, closing a file ensures that all data is properly written (flushed) to the disk, preventing data loss or corruption. Using with statements automates this process by closing the file automatically, making your code safer and cleaner."
